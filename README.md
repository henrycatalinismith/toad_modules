disk space each one is using.

Installation

npm install -g toad_modules
```

Usage
-----

```
toad_modules ~/Documents
```

I'm Feeling Lucky
-----------------

This little one-liner will quietly delete every node_modules directory anywhere
within your current working directory. It's a dangerous, destructive operation,
so please consult your horoscope before copypasting this into your terminal.

```
toad_modules | grep -v TOTAL | awk '{ print $2; }' | xargs rm -r
```

It won't ask you if you're sure first. It will begin deleting almost immediately.
But you seem like you know what you're doing, so go for it üëç
